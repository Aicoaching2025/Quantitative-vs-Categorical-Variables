# 📊 Exploring Associations Between Variables

In this lesson, we used **summary statistics** and **data visualization** tools to examine the relationship between **quantitative** and **categorical** variables.

## 📝 Key Concepts Covered

### 📌 1. Evaluating Mean & Median Differences
- We calculated **mean and median differences** to understand how a quantitative variable (e.g., `Fare`) varies across categories (e.g., `Survived` vs. `Did Not Survive`).
- **Example**: Survivors tend to have higher median `Fare` values than non-survivors.

### 📌 2. Side-by-Side Box Plots 📦
- Used **box plots** to compare distributions across categories.
- Box plots help visualize **spread, outliers, and central tendencies**.

### 📌 3. Overlapping Histograms 📊
- Histograms were used to visualize the **distribution of a numerical variable** across different groups.
- Helps understand **skewness, variance, and overlapping trends**.

### 📌 4. Pair-Wise Comparisons 🔄
- Compared **quantitative and categorical variables** where the categorical variable had more than two categories.
- Example: **Comparing `Fare` across different passenger classes (`Pclass`)**.

## 🔬 Next Steps: Hypothesis Testing 🧪
After calculating mean or median differences and visually comparing distributions, the **next step** is to perform a **hypothesis test**:
- **Question**: "Is this observed difference likely to exist in the **entire population**, or is it just due to chance?"
- **Example**: Will a similar difference in scores be observed for **ALL students** who ever attend these schools?

## 🏆 Apply These Techniques to Other Datasets
Now that you understand how to explore whether **variables are associated**, try these techniques on new datasets!

- 🎯 **Find relationships** in financial, medical, or social science data.
- 📊 **Use visualizations** to present insights clearly.
- 🧪 **Test hypotheses** using statistical methods.
